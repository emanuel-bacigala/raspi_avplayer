Raspberry Pi media player based on libav.

In order to build raspi_avplayer from source you need to:

    Build ilclient located at /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/libs/ilclient
        cd /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/libs/ilclient
        sudo make

    Install required libraries: 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev

    Build raspi_libavplayer
        make

Running 
    ./raspi_avplayer <input media file or stream>


For now the following hot-keys are supported:
    q               - exit
    s               - print some statistics
    space           - pause | resume playing
    d               - disable deinterlace
    D               - enable deinterlace
    +               - increase play speed
    -               - decrease play speed
